# Apollo Client Side

I have created the client side for the graphql app. I haven't bothered making a production build cause
I've done that before.

### Features:
- Responsive
- Uses:
  - React-FontAwesome
  - Tailwind CSS
  - tried using scss, but it wouldn't work for some reason
  - Apollo Client
- You can CRD
  - Create Book, Create Author
  - Read All Books, Read All Authors
  - Delete Book (no facility to delete author)

### Bugs:
- State changes keep changing the random color feature that I made
- Can't make proper dropdowns.
- The "bookshelf" does not reactively change on any CD actions, and only after refresh.
